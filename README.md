<h1>TalkHQ Mobile App</h1>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<p>React Native, Expo Go, Express.JS, PostgreSQL</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The TalkHQ Mobile Application was developed in conjunction with two other team members as part of a work integrated learning project at university. My role in this team was the lead programmer. We designed, created, and published a mobile application for the TalkHQ Speech Pathology located in Cairns Australia. This included weekly meetings with the client to ensure we meet their requirements for the application. These requirements included the ability for users to view, like, favourite, search for, and share a personalised feed of content that consists of blogs and videos.</p>
